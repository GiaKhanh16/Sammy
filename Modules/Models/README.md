# Models

## Overview

The `Models` module defines the core data structures used in the app. These models encapsulate the business domain's concepts, such as `Posts`, `Community`, and related types, without external dependencies.

This module is designed to:
- Provide a clear, reusable representation of the application's domain
- Ensure models remain decoupled from UI, networking, or persistance layers
- Serve as a single source of truth
